# Localization Examples

These samples show samples of implementing custom [services that localize the Telerik UI for Blazor components](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/globalization/localization). There is a server-side Blazor and a client-side Blazor (WASM) sample.

You can refer to the [offline version](https://www.telerik.com/account/my-downloads) of our [Demo solution](http://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/) for an up-to-date `TelerikMessages.resx` file with the keys used by the components in the respective version. The demo site also contains a sample implementation of a localization service. The local path to the `TelerikMessages.resx` files is showcased in the screenshot below.
