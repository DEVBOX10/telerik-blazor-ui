# Binding to Expando object

This example shows how to bind the TelerikGrid to `ExpandoObject` collections.

Such binding can be useful when you cannot or do not yet have actual models to use.

In this project, you will find two examples with binding.

*  Binding to `ExpandoObject` and defining Columns only for specific fields (see the `Index.razor` file)

    * This sample also showcases an example of editing

* Binding to `ExpandoObject` and generating Columns for all fields (see the `AutoGeneratedColumns.razor` file).

    * Editing is also possible, see the first example.

Key points:
   
- You must set up a Grid with columns and define the `FieldType` parameter of each column. The `FieldType` is a mandatory parameter when you are using dynamic objects.

- Specify the type of the `Data` to be `IEnumerable<ExpandoObject>`.

- Customize the grid depending on your needs. You can set groping, sorting filtering, etc.

- If you need `AutoGeneratedColumns`, you have to create them yourselfin a loop over the desired fields (see `AutoGeneratedColumns.razor`).

## Limitations

Using `ExpandoObject` instances for [nested fields](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/knowledge-base/grid-bind-navigation-property-complex-object) does not support filtering, sorting and grouping for those fields. You can disable these features per column.
